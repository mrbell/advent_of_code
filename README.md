# Advent of Code
## My solutions for various years

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code across the years. I have tended to solve using Python, and particularly sticking to native Python without use of any non-standard packages (e.g. I try to avoid using Numpy, although it would make some of the solutions much easier).

I have consolidated from previous repositories that contained solutions for individual years.
